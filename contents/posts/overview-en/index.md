## üé¨ Introduction

Before using Gatsby, I managed a personal blog with Jetbrains' [Writerside‚Üó](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/writerside/discover-writerside.html). While I was quite satisfied with the design elements, the tool, being primarily intended for document purposes, had many shortcomings for blog management (such as lack of RSS Feed support, difficulty in customization, and no GraphQL support).

Fortunately, I was able to get started with Gatsby thanks to [devHudi‚Üó](https://github.com/devHudi/gatsby-starter-hoodie), who generously shared a very well-crafted source on GitHub. Although I made some modifications to suit my needs, most of the source was created based on the original.

I extend my deep gratitude.
